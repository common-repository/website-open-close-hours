This plugin provides a conditional redirect functionality for the website opening and closing working hours.

== Description ==

This plugin provides a conditional redirect functionality. This allows you to redirect your visitors to a different page or offer on your website depending on a pre-allotted time in your timezone. As the admin you can set the timings for redirect according to day (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, … Sunday) or set start and end time for the entire week.

For example, you show consultation hours between the hours 8am to 5pm on Tuesday and Thursday. Any user visiting the website between the time will see you available, but outside of the timeframe will be redirected to your Contact Us page.

Any user of your website who is logged in will not be affected by this redirect.
